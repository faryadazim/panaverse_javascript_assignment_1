// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

const list_to_print = new Array("Mount Everest", "Nanga Parbat", "Koh e Sulemena", "Sang e Mar Mar");
